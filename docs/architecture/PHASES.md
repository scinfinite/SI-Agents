# SI-Agents Implementation Phases

**Current status: v2.0 track — Phases 1–16 complete and CI-verified. Phase 17 is next.**

1. Foundation — repository standards, architecture, policies, isolation, verification rules. **Complete.**
2. Control Plane — orchestration, task state, workflows, context, permissions, approvals, checkpoints. **Complete.**
3. Tool System — filesystem, terminal, Git, GitHub, web, code analysis, build/test tooling, containers, sandbox. **Complete.**
4. Engineering Brain — decomposition, planning, reasoning, hypotheses, root-cause analysis, trade-offs, uncertainty. **Complete.**
5. Developer/Debugger/Tester — first end-to-end engineering workflow and Alpha acceptance test. **Complete.**
6. Skills Engine — reusable, verifiable engineering procedures, lifecycle, selection, permissioned execution, and evidence. **Complete.**
7. Verification + Evidence — claims, evidence provenance, confidence, regression, red-team checks, production-readiness gates. **Complete.**
8. Technical Knowledge — universal programming model, languages, frameworks, ecosystems, standards. **Complete.**
9. Technology Discovery — detect, research, experiment, verify, and record unfamiliar technologies. **Complete.**
10. Open-Source Intelligence — repository archaeology, history, issues, PRs, releases, security, licenses, health. **Complete.**
11. Pattern Extraction — deterministic normalization, conservative extraction, independent validation, counterexamples, provenance, promotion, and matching. **Complete.**
12. Engineering Memory — task/project/global memory, evidence-gated promotion, scoped retrieval, lifecycle, supersession, and auditable persistence. **Complete.**
13. Security + Legal + Cost — executable governance gates, free-first cost controls, data classification/egress, provenance/legal review, risk classification, approvals, and audit evidence. **Complete.**
14. Model/Provider Intelligence — capability, quota, cost, latency, reliability, fallback, circuit breakers. **Complete.**
15. Automation — scheduled research, monitoring, maintenance, testing, reporting, retries, idempotency, lifecycle, persistence, and governance-gated execution. **Complete.**
16. Controlled Self-Improvement + Capability Intelligence — evidence-backed proposals, benchmark/regression/safety gates, explicit approval, rollback, capability readiness intelligence, conservative unknown handling, and auditable persistence. **Complete.**
17. Harness & Runtime Interoperability — OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, Cline, Termux, Codespaces, terminal, and future harness adapters over one SI-Agents core.
18. Production Hardening — end-to-end reliability, security, performance, compatibility, migration, observability, and release readiness.

## Release targets

- **Alpha:** phases 0–5 — achieved
- **Beta:** phases 6–9 — **complete**
- **v1.0:** phases 10–13 — **complete**
- **v1.5:** phases 14–15 — **complete**
- **v2.0:** phases 16–18 — in progress

## Verification rule

A phase is not considered complete merely because its files exist. Its acceptance criteria must be implemented, relevant tests must pass, CI must verify installation/build/lint/tests, and any CI failure discovered during completion must be fixed and rerun before the phase is declared complete.

## Phase 16 completion

Phase 16 delivers a controlled learning pipeline in which evidence-backed proposals are evaluated through independent benchmark, regression, and safety gates before explicit approval. Application and rollback are externally supplied operations, so the learning engine cannot silently mutate code. Capability intelligence computes deterministic readiness signals from evidence, verification, benchmark, health, and confidence; missing signals are conservative, blocked capabilities score zero, and only validated capabilities are considered executable candidates. JSON persistence preserves proposal/evaluation evidence without adding a database dependency. Automatic code mutation, automatic capability promotion, automatic global promotion, and secret storage remain disabled by policy.

## Prior phase completion

Phases 10–15 delivered provenance-preserving open-source intelligence, evidence-gated pattern extraction, scoped engineering memory, executable security/legal/cost governance, typed model/provider intelligence, and governance-gated automation. Their existing completion documents remain authoritative for their respective acceptance criteria and verification evidence.
